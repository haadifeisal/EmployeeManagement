# EmployeeManagement

This is a simple Web Api project running in .NET 5. The purpose of this application is not to focus on .NET and develop advanced REST API's, rather it's to understand how to utilize and combine different technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub workflows and etc to automate, scale, and manage containerized applications. And most importantly to facilitate the development process ;)
