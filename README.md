# EmployeeManagement

This is a simple Web Api project running in .NET 6. The purpose of this application is not to put much weight and focus on the standard .NET/Web Api development process, rather it's to understand how to utilize and combine different technologies such as Kubernetes, GitHub workflows and etc, to automate, scale, and manage containerized applications. And most importantly to facilitate the development process ;)

Below are some of the tools/technologies used in this project:
.NET 6 (.NET Core Web Api)
Docker
Kubernetes
PostgreSQL
Keycloak
GitHub actions/workflows


To run the application in docker:

1. Place yourself in the /EmployeeManagement directory, then run the following command docker-compose up --build
2. Browse to http://localhost:5003/swagger/index.html to see the application.
