# EmployeeManagement

This is a simple Web Api project running in .NET 5. The purpose of this application is not to put much weight and focus on the standard .NET development process, rather it's to understand how to utilize and combine different technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub workflows and etc, to automate, scale, and manage containerized applications. And most importantly to facilitate the development process ;)


To run the application in docker:

1. Place yourself in the /EmployeeManagement directory, then run the following command docker-compose up --build
2. Go to http://localhost:5003/swagger/index.html to see the application.
